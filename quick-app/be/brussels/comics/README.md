# Quick App Sample: Brussels Comic Route

This quick app is an open-source project, powered by open data and enriched by the community.

Most of the information was extracted from Wikidata, OpenStreetMaps and public sources. 

If you have seen any inaccuracy or if you want to contribute with your experience or pictures, please let me know raising an issue on this project.

Thank you!!

Note: This quick app must run directly using the Quick App IDE, the only dependency is the [geolib](https://github.com/manuelbieh/geolib) library to measure distances. This dependency is already in the `package.json`.
