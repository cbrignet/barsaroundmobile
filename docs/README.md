# _Heritage in…_ Quick App

[![JSON Check & Publication](https://github.com/ow2-quick-app-initiative/poi-quick-app-implementations/actions/workflows/gh-deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ow2-quick-app-initiative/poi-quick-app-implementations/actions/workflows/gh-deploy.yml)

The _Heritage in…_ Quick App project promotes cultural heritage collections in small and medium cities through open data and crowdsourcing. 

> It's free, open-source, and collaborative 

Any city can implement its own application in a few hours. They only need one or more experts to feed the first version of the database. 

__If you are interested, please visit the main repository with the [methodology and the templates](https://github.com/ow2-quick-app-initiative/poi-quick-app), and explore some [existing implementation examples](https://ow2-quick-app-initiative.github.io/poi-quick-app/#Examplesofimplementations).__

## Privacy

These apps are based on open data and automatic processing of the data. The community's content is enriched and curated, so it's available to anyone who wants to get involved. Local experts are welcome to refine the definitions, names, and pictures and add new points of interest to the app.

The app doesn't collect any personal data, so relax. We won't sell anything.

The app may perform a call to a [Matomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matomo_(software)) instance to measure its performance, but no personal data is shared. You can just [check the code](https://github.com/ow2-quick-app-initiative/poi-quick-app-implementations/blob/eb7cd317eced2fe6ebe51e5210589aff7ac2675e/quick-app/leuven/src/app.ux#L222) that generates a random identifier.  

## Developers
